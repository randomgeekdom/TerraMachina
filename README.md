# Terra Machina
A site for the tabletop RPG Terra Machina

Terra Machina is a tabletop RPG based loosely on Dungeon World by Sage LaTorra and Adam Koebel.  It imagines a Tolkienesque world where time has passed to the point where technology is just as powerful as magic.  Taking inspiration from Japanese roleplaying video games of the 32-bit era, it is a unique experience that hopes to combine the best elements of fantasy, science fiction, and action.
